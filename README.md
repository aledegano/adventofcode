# aledegano Advent of code

This are my solutions for the [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

## Disclaimer

I solve this puzzles optimizing for the time it takes me to solve them.
This means that I don't care about the readability of the code, its performance or its elegance.
If it works, it works and I immediately stop working on it.
That clearly will not lead to great code, so do not expect it...
